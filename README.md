# CS250-Homework

This repository contains all code written for Duke's CS250 â€” Computer Architecture class on Spring 2022. Per the class description, the course main objective was to *learn how computers work, focusing on how the computer hardware executes the software.* The schedule included topics on *instruction sets (MIPS), assembly language programming, basic digital logic design, processor design, memory system design, and input/output.*

A full description of the course can be [found here](https://web.archive.org/web/20220704180757/http://people.ee.duke.edu/~sorin/ece250/).

Each homework had the purpose of teaching specific topics within Computer Architecture, which are detailed below:

**Homework 1:** C, pointers, memory, malloc. This is an algorithm that parsers a list of infected-transmitter name pairs into a sorted list of transmitter names and who they infected.

**Homework 2**: Assembly, MIPS ISA. The same algorithm written in homework 1, but manually "compiled" into assembly language.

**Homework 3**: Circuit logic design in Logisim. Includes circuit for an adder, circuitry following truth tables, and a Finite State Machine.

**Homework 4**: a fully functioning CPU! Included circuitry for load-word, store-word, beq, blt, or, and, addi, add, sub, subi, shr (shift-right), shl (shift-left), j, jal and IO output/input instructions. Only basic components were allowed (Gates, decoders/multiplexers, ROM, RAM, D Flip-Flops, etc.). See it for yourself; it's pretty cool!

**Homework 5**: a model for a CPU cache. Process stores and loads within certain memory addresses, indicating whether memory operation was a miss or a hit. Algorithm included handling for write-back, write-through, write-allocate, and write-non-allocate caches.

## A note on Duke's Community Standard

In CS250, getting help from friends, the internet, or existing homework is considered a form of Academic Misconduct; one should refer to the course TAs for that. I am posting my solutions to the homework problems here as part of my portfolio since we are allowed to do it after final grades are posted. As such, I expect that if you are a current student in this class, you should not refer to any of my code to do your work.

Homework solutions are very unique to whoever wrote them, specially if you didn't need much help from the TAs. So please avoid some plagiarism and a visit to the Duke's Office of Student Conduct
